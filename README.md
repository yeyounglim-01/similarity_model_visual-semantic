# 💎 Trademark Similarity Analysis System
> Tip analyzes trademark similarity according to the three legal standards used in trademark infringement judgments: appearance, pronunciation, and concept.

AI-powered trademark similarity analysis system that detects potential trademark infringement by analyzing **semantic (conceptual) similarity** and *visual similarity* between trademarks.

This project combines **natural language understanding** and **computer vision models** to provide a more comprehensive trademark similarity evaluation.

# 📍 Overview

**Tip (Trademark Intelligence Platform)** is an AI-powered trademark monitoring system that analyzes similarity across **visual appearance, pronunciation, and conceptual meaning** — the three legal criteria used in trademark infringement judgment.

Unlike conventional services that rely on simple keyword searches or image matching, Tip applies AI-based analysis to provide more meaningful and legally relevant trademark similarity detection, helping brands identify potential infringement risks early.

# 🛡️ Key Features

* **Legal-Based Similarity Analysis** <br>
Analyzes trademark similarity based on the three legal criteria used in trademark law: visual appearance, pronunciation, and conceptual meaning.

* **Visual Similarity Analysis (Appearance)** <br>
Detects visually similar trademarks by analyzing logo structure, shapes, and design elements using deep learning models.

* **Semantic Similarity Analysis (Concept)** <br>
Evaluates conceptual similarity between trademarks using AI-generated descriptions and semantic embeddings.

* **Automated Similarity Scoring** <br>
Calculates similarity scores between target and candidate trademarks using vector-based comparison.

* **Modular AI Architecture** <br>
Designed with a modular structure to allow easy expansion of additional models such as phonetic similarity analysis.

# 💻 Models

## Semantic Similarity Model
The semantic similarity model analyzes the **conceptual meaning of trademarks** using text embeddings.

Process:

**1.** Generate text descriptions of trademark images <br>
**2.** Convert descriptions into semantic embeddings <br>
**3.** Compare embedding vectors using similarity metrics <br>
**4.** Calculate conceptual similarity scores <br>
More details are available in:

# Visual Similarity Model
The visual similarity model compares trademarks based on their **visual appearance.**

The model extracts visual features from trademark images and computes similarity scores between feature vectors.

Typical pipeline:

**1.** Detect trademark region <br>
**2.** Extract visual features using CNN <br>
**3.** Convert image into embedding vector <br>
**4.** Compute similarity between vectors <br>
